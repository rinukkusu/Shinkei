an IRC bot written in C# with a massive plugin system.

Fancy stuff that needs to be done
---------------------------------
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Input loop</b>
    <br/>
    We need an input loop in <code>Program.cs</code> for interacting on console level
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Aliases for servers</b>
    <br/>
    To interact properly from the console or to find servers from our plugins, we might want to add aliases to the server configuration and also in the settings
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Events for server reponse codes</b>
  </li>
  
  
</ul>
