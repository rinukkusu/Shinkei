Shinkei
=======

an IRC bot written in C# with a massive plugin system.

Fancy stuff that needs to be done
---------------------------------
- [ ] an input loop in <code>Program.cs</code> for interacting on console level
- [ ] aliases for servers to interact properly from the console or to find servers from our plugins
- [ ] usage of template functions for registering events (don't expose <code>Eventsink</code>)
